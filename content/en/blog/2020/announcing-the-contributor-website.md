Welcome to [kubernetes.dev], the Kubernetes Contributor website; built to become
the one stop shop for Kubernetes contributor content and news. It brings
important documentation scattered throughout the project into **one central
location**.

## Resources for contributors
At launch, the contributor site will host a subset of our documentation. Some
highlights include (with short links in parenthesis):
- Our contributor guide ([k8s.dev/guide]) walks you through the first steps to
  becoming a contributor
- The contributor cheatsheet ([k8s.dev/cheatsheet]) has  common tips and tricks
  for regular contribution
- The community calendar ([k8s.dev/calendar]) shows all the upcoming community
  group meetings
- Current release cycle information ([k8s.dev/release]) lets you stay up-to-date
  on upcoming release deadlines and milestones.


**TIP:** As seen above, the [k8s.dev] domain can be substituted for
[kubernetes.dev] for easy short-linking :)


## More resources to come

You can look forward to some of these other resources being offered here in the
near future:
- [The Developer Guide]
- Common contributor requests such as: [subproject websites], [repo creation],
  and [slack channel] requests
- Provide New Contributor Workshop courses
- Contributor Tips and Tricks focused blog posts
- Contributor Summit and other event information
- And much more!

If you’d like to see some specific information surfaced on this site, please
open an issue in the [kubernetes-sigs/contributor-site] repo detailing what sort
of documentation you’d like to be surfaced.
