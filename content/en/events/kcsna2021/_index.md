### About

The North America Summit will be an informal event taking place on October 11th
in Los Angeles, California alongside
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">KubeCon</a>
at the
<a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/laxjw-jw-marriott-los-angeles-la-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JW Marriott LA Live</a>.


We are downsizing the event due to low registration numbers so we can focus on
the virtual contributor celebration later in 2021. However, we will still have a
space to hang out, catch up, and meet new contributors. We also have space
available for SIGs or subprojects that wish to do a mini hackathon, sprint, or
other collaboration. To reserve the sapce, please reach out to
community@kubernetes.io or ask in the
<a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/summit-staff" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#summit-staff</a>

This page will be updated with more information as it develops. If you have
questions or comments, please reach out to the Summit Staff by emailing
community@kubernetes.io or asking in the
<a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/contributor-summit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#contributor-summit</a>
slack channel.
