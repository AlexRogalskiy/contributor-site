As we are not holding the formal Contributor Summit, we are not
running registration. SIGs and subprojects who choose to hold a mini-event will
be responsible for any kind of signups they need to manage.

**NOTE:** Any in-person events held by SIGs and subprojects will follow KubeConâ€™s
[Health & Safety Guidelines] requiring **ALL** in-person attendees to be fully
vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus.
