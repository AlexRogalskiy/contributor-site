### About

The North America Summit will take place October 11th, in Los Angeles, California
alongside [KubeCon] at the [JW Marriott LA Live].


It will be a fully hybrid event enabling those that cannot attend in person to
participate remotely. However, due to the uncertainty involved with attending
the event, the focus will be on unconference sessions and providing a space for
our contributors to break off and hold smaller focused discussions.

This page will be updated with more information as it develops. If you have
questions or comments, please reach out to the Summit Staff by emailing
community@kubernetes.io or asking in the [`#contributor-summit`] slack channel.

### Registration

Registration is not yet open, a notice of reg opening will be sent to out to
the regular Contributor comms channels (kubernetes-dev, twitter etc.).

### Code of Conduct

Attendees agree to abide by Kubernetes [Code of Conduct]. More information on
how to report an event will be posted in the future.
