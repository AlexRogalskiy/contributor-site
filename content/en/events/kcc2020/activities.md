## Events

### Kubernetes Contributor Awards

- [Session link](https://sched.co/gC19)

Kubernetes SIG Co-Chairs and Tech Leads would like for you to attend this special
event where we honor and dedicate the hard work that the community has been
working on. These peer awards are a tradition at the Kubernetes Contributor
Summits so we are bringing them virtual, please join us to thank and support all
the people who have worked hard to help us this year.

### Most Extreme Kubernetes Challenge - DevOps Party Game

- [Friday Session Link](https://sched.co/gC1L)
- [Saturday Session Link](https://sched.co/gC1U)

Join [Ian Coldwater] along with [Jeremy Meiss] as they host a special edition of
the [DevOps Party Game]. We will have Kubernetes questions and panelists to take
this variation of a party game to another level! There will be two sessions to
cover time zones, and we’ll be broadcasting this to the [Kubernetes YouTube channel].
Audience participation makes this a fun time for all attendees!

We will be giving away lots of great prizes!

### The Great Cloud Native Bake Off

- [Session Link](https://sched.co/gCUR)

A virtual cooking even styled after the Great British Bake-off will be held
during the Kubernetes celebration Event hosted by CNCF Ambassador [Kat Cosgrove]
on Saturday Dec 12 at 12pm PT.

- Contestants will have 90 minutes to cook a Kubernetes themed dessert.  Anything
  goes, as long as the majority of preparation is done live.  The competition is
  open to all skill levels, from baking from a cake mix to grinding your own
  flour as long as you can theme it to Kubernetes.
- Contestants will be responsible for their own recipes and acquiring their
  ingredients. If you need help with either of these, let us know!
- Contestants will be expected to join a video conference call 30 mins prior to
  kick off, and should have a phone or ipad with a stand (or a patient friend )
  to capture them preparing their dessert.
- Our Host and Commentators will provide commentary on our contestants and will
  ask each contestant questions through the event. At the end of the 90minutes
  we’ll be joined by an esteemed group of expert judges who will judge your
  (hopefully completed) dessert on the following criteria:
  - **Execution:** How well does it fit the “Kubernetes theme”
  - **Appearance:** How does it look?
  - **Taste:** Obviously the judges can’t taste it, so they’ll need to be
    creative for this one.

We’re looking for cooks of all backgrounds and talents. If this sounds like fun
to you and you want to cook with us,  email pczarkowski@vmware.com with the
subject _“Great Kubernetes Bake-off”_. List your name, company you work for, your
self-assessed cooking skills (from 1 to 5, 5 being Gordon Ramsey), a twitter
handle (or other social media) and any other details you wish to provide.

## Games

For Linux players, there are no game specific instructions, but many
can run on Linux through [proton](https://www.protondb.com/)

**NOTE:** These are attendee suggestion driven and should not be considered an
endorsement for the Kubernetes project as a whole.

### Among Us

[Game Site](https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us)

**Platforms:** PC ([Steam][au-steam] / [itch.io][au-itch]) | [Android][au-android] | [iOS][au-ios]

**NOTE:** It's Cross-Platform!

Join your crewmates in a multiplayer game of teamwork and betrayal!

Play online with 4-10 community members as you attempt to hold your spaceship
together and return back to civilization. But beware...as there may be alien
impostors aboard!

One or two crewmates have been replaced by parasitic shapeshifters. Their goal
is to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. The Impostors
will sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, deceive, and frame others to
remain anonymous and kill off the crew.

While everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity.
Once a body is reported, the surviving crew will openly debate who they think
The Impostor is. The Impostors’ goal is to pretend that they are a member of
the crew. If The Impostor is not voted off, everyone goes back to maintaining
the ship until another body is found. If The Impostors are voted off, the crew
wins!


**Reporting:** There is no in-game reporting mechanism. If there is an issue
with a Kubernetes community member, please use the `/report` command or contact
the [CoCC directly].

### Animal Crossing

[Game Site][ac-site]

**Platforms:** [Nintendo Switch][ac-switch]

<i>“Escape to a deserted island and create your own paradise as you explore,
create, and customize in the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game. Your island
getaway has a wealth of natural resources that can be used to craft everything
from tools to creature comforts. You can hunt down insects at the crack of dawn,
decorate your paradise throughout the day, or enjoy sunset on the beach while
fishing in the ocean. The time of day and season match real life, so each day
on your island is a chance to check in and find new surprises all year round.

Show off your island utopia to family and friends—or pack your bags and visit
theirs. Whether playing online* or with others beside you**, island living is
even better when you can share it. Even without hopping on a flight, you’ll meet
a cast of charming animal residents bursting with personality. Friendly faces
like Tom Nook and Isabelle will lend their services and happily help you grow
your budding community. Escape to your island getaway—however, whenever, and
wherever you want.”</i> - [Nintendo][ac-nin]

### Destiny 2

[Game Site][d2-site]

**Platforms:** PC ([Steam][d2-steam]) | [Xbox][d2-xbox] | [Playstation][d2-ps] | [Stadia][d2-stadia]

Destiny is a multiplayer scifi/fantasy space shooter game with lots of guns and
space super powers. Players can team up in 3 person squads for missions called
strikes, 4 player teams for Gambit, and up to 6v6 in player-vs-player.

**Preparation:** The base game is free to play, however there is no cross play,
so we’ll have to group up by platform. Download the game before the event since
it’s about 70GB. You’ll probably want to do the tutorial campaign ahead of time
to get a feel for the game. Ideally complete enough of the introduction to be
able to head to “The Tower”.

**Reporting:** Reporting can be done via the “Roster” tab in game. Generally
speaking chat is done via third party tools so other than player usernames you
don’t typically chat with other players. If there is an issue with a Kuberntes
community member, please use the `/report` command or contact the [CoCC directly].

**Guides / New Player Coaches:** Jorge Castro (PC), Allison Downey(PC),and Wayne
Witzel(PC)

### Fall Guys

[Game Site][fg-site]

**Platforms:** PC ([Steam][fg-steam]) | [Playstation][fg-ps]

Up to 60 players compete in matches with battle royale-style gameplay. Players,
represented as jellybean-like figures, move around a three-dimensional playing
field, with additional moves such as jumping, grabbing/climbing, or diving to
assist gameplay. The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully
completing each of the randomly selected mini-games. Certain mini-games involve
running towards a finish line at the end of the map, while others add elements
of teamwork. On every mini-game, obstacles appear around the map for added
complexity. Players who are too slow or who fail certain requirements for a
mini-game are eliminated. On the final round, the remaining few players compete
in a final match with a randomised mini-game designed for a smaller player size.
The winner of the match is the last player standing.

**Reporting:** There is no in-game reporting mechanism. If there is an issue with
a Kubernetes community member, please use the `/report` command or contact the
[CoCC directly].
