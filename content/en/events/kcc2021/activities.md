## Events

### Kubernetes Contributor Awards

Kubernetes SIG Co-Chairs and Tech Leads would like for you to attend this special
event where we honor and dedicate the hard work that the community has been
working on. These peer awards are a tradition at the Kubernetes Contributor
Summits so we are bringing them virtual, please join us to thank and support all
the people who have worked hard to help us this year.

### Most Extreme Kubernetes Challenge - DevOps Party Game

DevOps Party Games takes the idea of “online party games” and tilts it on its
head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then streams it
live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be
entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss, and Dan Maher)
will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and
Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball).” There will be a Kubernetes slant
for this edition of DevOps Party Games.

### The Great Cloud Native Bake Off

We take cooking and baking pretty seriously in the Cloud Native ecosystem; we
do have a [Cloud Native Community Cookbook] after all. “We will be selecting
6 to 8 Kubernetes contributors to participate in the second annual BakeOff
(K8sBO). No professional experience is required … just enthusiasm, availability,
and the willingness to wash a lot of dishes.” If you’re interested in baking,
please [sign up] for the Bake Off as soon as possible.

### Krafternetes

All day December 16th, creative folks will be showing up in the Krafternetes 
channel on Discord to share art, music, and performances. Between studio tours, 
a collaborative "quick draw" session, or online performances, the artists of
Kubernetes will have events all day to share with you.  If you're interested in
participating, speak up in channel Krafternetes on [slack].
